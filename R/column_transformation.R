## *Note*: For better comprehension, this function should be read
## *after* understanding the `mungebit` and `mungepiece`
## classes defined in this package.
## 
## In general, transformations of a single data.frame into another
## data.frame fall in three categories:
##
##   1. **Column transformations**. A one-variable function applied to
##      an atomic vector (a column) that yields a new vector of the same length.
##   2. **Row transformations**. A column transformation with a matrix
##      transposition composed to the left and right of it (i.e., operating
##      on rows instead of columns).
##   3. **Whole dataframe transformations**. Any transformation that
##      cannot be expressed as a column or row transformation: for example,
##      a transposition or multiple imputation.
##
## The `column_transformation` function is a helper that takes
## a function with at least one argument--the atomic vector (column)
## being operated on, with additional arguments acting as further
## parametrization--and turns that function into a function suitable
## for use with a mungebit that will operate on an entire data.frame.
## For example,
##
## ```r
## stripper <- column_transformation(function(x) {
##   gsub("[[:space:]]", "", x)
## })
## new_dataset <- stripper(dataset, c("column1", "column2"))
## ```
##
## The function produced, `stripper`, accepts a data.frame as its
## first argument and as its second argument a vector of column names
## (or several other formats; see the `standard_column_format` helper).
##
## The argument `name` is reserved, and if you create a column transformation
## from a function that includes this argument, its value will be set
## to the name of the column:
##
## ```r
## adjoin_name <- column_transformation(function(x, name) {
##   paste0(x, "_", name)
## })
## new_dataset <- adjoin_name(dataset, c("column1", "column2"))
## # If column1 and column2 are character vectors, they will now
## # have all their values prefixed with `column1_` and `column2_`,
## # respectively.
## ```
##
## TODO: (RK) List many more examples here and explain column transformation
## standard column format usage.
#' Pure column transformations.
#'
#' A mungebit which affects multiple columns identically and independently
#' can be abstracted into a column transformation. This function allows one
#' to specify what happens to an individual column, and the mungebit will be
#' the resulting column transformation applied to an arbitrary combination of
#' columns.
#'
#' @param transformation function. The function's first argument will
#'    receive an atomic vector derived from some \code{data.frame}. If the
#'    \code{transformation} has a \code{name} argument, it will receive
#'    the column name. Any other arguments will be received as the
#'    \code{list(...)} from calling the function produced by 
#'    \code{column_transformation}.
#' @param nonstandard logical. If \code{TRUE}, nonstandard evaluation support
#'    will be provided for the derived function, so it will be possible
#'    to capture the calling expression for each column. By default \code{FALSE}.
#'    Note this will slow the transformation by 0.1ms on each column.
#' @return a function which takes a data.frame and a vector of column
#'    names (or several other formats, see \code{\link{standard_column_format}})
#'    and applies the \code{transformation}.
#' @seealso \code{\link{multi_column_transformation}}, \code{\link{standard_column_format}}
#' @note The function produced by calling \code{column_transformation} will
#'    not run independently. It must be used a train or predict function for
#'    a \code{\link{mungebit}}.

  ## We will construct a function *from scratch*. Since R is almost
  ## [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language\))
  ## under the hood, it is possible to construct a function piece-by-piece.
  ##
  ## In general, an R function [consists of three components](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html):
  ##
  ##  * **Formals**. The arguments to the function. You can access these
  ##    for any function using the [`formals`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/formals.html)
  ##    helper. This is a named list of expressions, with the values being
  ##    the defaults for each argument.
  ##  * **Body**. The body of the function. In R, a block of code can be 
  ##    represented within R itself as a `language` object. Specifically,
  ##    using [`quote`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/substitute.html)
  ##    can be used to construct the *body* of a function, as in
  ##    `quote({ a <- 1; print(a); return(a) })`. This is a form of
  ##    [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming\)).
  ##  * **Environment**. The R environment the function has access to
  ##    when looking for local variables. In other words, its lexical
  ##    environment [as a closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming\)).
  ## 
  ## For a `column_transformation`, its derived transformation will be
  ## a new function that takes a `data` argument and a vector of `columns`,
  ## and executes the `transformation` on each column.
  ##
  ## Note we have to inject a few helpers like `%||%` and `list2env_safe`,
  ## which are defined in the mungebits2 package internals, since these
  ## may not be available when a mungebit is serialized and exported out of
  ## the active R session (if mungebits2 is not attached to the search path).
